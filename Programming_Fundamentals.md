### Software Development - Fundamental steps in software development ###
***
**Requirements definition**:  
- Who does the job? A business systems analyst.
- How are the needs of the client met? Compiling a list of required outputs/inputs through surveys, interviews, time management studies, business analysis.
- Environment Vs Boundary: The environment is everything that is influenced or influences the systems, and the boundary is the delineation between a system and its environenment (boundary defines what is and isnt a part of the environment -> system is the interface between).
  
   
**Determining specification**:  
  - Functional Vs Non-Functional: Functional specifications describe what the system must do (they define the features, actions, and behaviours -> e.g. 'User can log in with a password'). Non-functional specifications describe how well the system must perform (they define quality, performance, and constraints -> e.g. 'Page loads within 2 seconds').
  - Developer Vs User Perspective: Developer is only concerned with the code/software, whereas the user is concerned with the outputs and how well it functions.

**Design**:  
- What System and Data modelling tools are there? Context Diagrams, Data flow diagrams, Structure charts, Data dictionary, Storyboard, Decision trees (and tables), Class Diagram.
